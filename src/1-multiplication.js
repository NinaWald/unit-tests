/*
 This is a JavaScript function named "multiply" that takes two parameters, a and b. However, 
 there is a missing part in the code that prevents it from returning the result of the multiplication. 
 
 export: This keyword is used when you want to export a function, object, 
 or value from a JavaScript module so that it can be imported and used in other modules.

 const: This keyword is used to declare a constant variable. In this case, 
 it's used to declare a constant named "multiply" that holds a function as its value.

 multiply: This is the name of the function. You can call it whatever you like.

 (a, b): These are the parameters of the function. Parameters are like variables that store the values passed to the function when it is called. 
 In this case, a and b are the two parameters representing the values you want to multiply.

 =>: This is an arrow function syntax, also known as a fat arrow function. 
 It's a concise way to define functions in JavaScript.

 a * b: This is the multiplication operation that multiplies the values of a and b. 
 However, as mentioned earlier, 
 this part was missing in the code you provided. 
 To ensure the function returns the result, we need to use the return keyword.

 return: This keyword is used to specify the value that a function should return. 
 In this case, the result of a * b is returned by the function.
